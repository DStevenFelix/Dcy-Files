Ladies and gentlemen,

Today, I want to discuss the evolving relationship between humans and robots. As we step into a new technological era, understanding our interaction with robots is crucial.

Robots have changed a lot. They used to be just machines in factories. But Now, they help us in many ways such as housework and health care so on.

The essence of human-robot relations lies i n collaboration. Robots take on repetitive or dangerous tasks, allowing us to concentrate on complex problems.

However, integrating robots into our daily lives bring challenges. How do we ensure robots respect our values and privacy? How do we address job displacement due to automation? These critical issues demand thoughtful consideration and solutions.

Education is fundamental to our future with robots. Teaching robotics, ethics, and social sciences will equip us with knowledge to navigate this new area responsibly.

We must also ensure that the benefits of robots are shared by all. This involves making technology accessible, promoting diversity in robotics, and so on.

In conclusion, the dynamic relationship between humans and robots holds great promise for enhancing our lives. By fostering collaboration, and addressing ethical concerns, we can create a future where humans and robots thrive together.



Thank you.
